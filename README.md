My name is Ariel Hanasab and I am a third year statistics student at UCLA. This repository is for Coding for Humanities, a course offered at UCLA. The project I intend to complete is an interavtice choropleth map of S&P 500 companies, based on their respective headquarters, representing the highest influence (market cap) on stock price changes throughout the years. My objective for this course is to get a formal take on data science to better my current informal experience.
