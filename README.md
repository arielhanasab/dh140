My name is Ariel Hanasab and I am a third year statistics student at UCLA. This repository is for Coding for Humanities, a course offered at UCLA. The project I intend to complete is determining which cities, counties, and states, based on their respective companies, have the highest influence on stock price changes based on historical, publicly available, stock market data. My objective for this course is to get a formal take on data science to better my current informal experience.
