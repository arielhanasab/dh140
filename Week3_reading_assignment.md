I think it is a great cause to use open data for humanitarian purposes. It especially useful when there is limited resources and low funding. What can help with open data is perhaps an incentive program, similar to the ones offered to white hat hackers, that rewards people who clean up open data that needs a ton a cleaning and wrangling to be useful. Additionally, some prewritten machine learning algorithms that apply to most open-source humanitarian data may be helpful in predicting certain trends.
