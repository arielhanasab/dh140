It was a great point to make that when mass tweets are read together they are given equal weight when in fact they probably shouldn't be. I was not at all aware of the efforts done against government-controlled media. Especially when it comes to Iran, where my parents are from. I in general have a negative outlook towards social media but seeing that there are still a few that use it for good gives me hope that social media still has a place in the world. My questions for the author are how did you identify misinformation? How did you handle the misinformation? And all the while, how did you remove your own bias?
