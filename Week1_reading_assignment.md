[Maps of where the Fortune 500 companies in R](https://medium.com/@wenjun.sarah.sun/maps-of-where-the-fortune-500-companies-in-r-6ee6e98c64f8)

# Summary
The author creates maps of Fortune 500 companies’ headquarters and then proceeds to relate their respective locations to the state’s income tax. The first map is a basic choropleth map, but because it is misleading—the states are different sizes—the author showed an alternative map representing the states as the same size. The author continued with interactive choropleth maps, one of HQs by state and the other shaded by corporate income tax rates. Finally, because the author was trying to find the **association** between tax rates and number of HQs, the article concluded with a scatter plot.
